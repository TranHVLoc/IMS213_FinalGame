## Game Concept and Storyline
- Setting: The game takes place in an endangered ecosystem, a rainforest.
- Character: Players control an eco-warrior. His only duty is collecting as many as trashbags as possible.
- Objective: The main goal is to clean up pollutants and rescue wildlife affected by environmental hazards. Completing these tasks helps restore the health of the ecosystem.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Object Collection: Players collect different types of trash or pollutants (plastic, oil, chemical waste). Each collected item
could contribute to a score that reflects the health of the ecosystem.
- Object Avoidance: Players must avoid hazards such as oil spills, toxic gases, or dangerous wildlife. These challenges require agility and strategy to navigate.
- Timed Performance: Certain levels might include a timer to clean up a spill before it spreads too much. Success could lead to bonus points or unlock special abilities.
- Multi-planar Course: The level design includes climbing over obstacles, diving underwater, or navigating tree canopies, making full use of the 3D platforming elements.
- Ordered Actions: Players might need to find specific items that enable them to access blocked areas or cleanse heavily polluted zones. For example, finding a water filtration device to clean a pond and rescue aquatic life.

## Visual and Audio Elements
- Visuals: Animations for pollution effects and wildlife add to the immersion.
- Audio: Background music that reflects the serene, yet endangered world. Sound effects for actions like collecting trash and wildlife sounds create a realistic atmosphere.

## Additional Features
- Intro Screen: A simple yet compelling introduction that outlines the character's mission and the game's purpose.
Game Over Screen: Reflects the outcome of the player's effortsâ€”either showing a restored ecosystem or one that still needs help, encouraging replayability.
- On-screen Score: Helps keep the player informed about their impact on the environment
- Timer: Helps keep the player informed about the urgency of their missions.
- In-game Music and Sound Effects: Enhance the player's experience with sounds that are appropriate for the setting, such as ocean waves for coral reef levels or bird calls in rainforests.

 ## Game Rule
 - Very simple, try to earn at least **20** scores within 2 minutes
 - Grab 1 trashbag and you will earn 1 score
 - If you collide with an alligator, your score will be deducted by 2. So be careful!
 - Other animals will do no harm to you, but they can be obstacles to avoid alligators from snapping you
